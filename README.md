# Privacy Preserving Voting for Humans on Starknet

This repo was made during the post-EthCC[4] hackathon.

Props to [Kobi](https://github.com/kobigurk) for being the big brain behind [stardrop](https://github.com/kobigurk/stardrop).

An online demo is available [here](https://private-voting.pscott.me).

The code is dirty and hacked everywhere. Lots of improvements are yet to be made, this is a POC, not production-ready code :)

If you wish to run it locally, simply run `./start_local.sh`.

Then, you should have the frontend served on `http:://localhost:3000`. Simply open up the browser and you'll be good to go!
