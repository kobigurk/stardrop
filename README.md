# Privacy Preserving Voting for Humans on Starknet

This repo was made during the post-EthCC[4] hackathon.

Props to [Kobi](https://github.com/kobigurk) for being the big brain behind [stardrop](https://github.com/kobigurk/stardrop).

The code is dirty and hacked everywhere. It will get updated in the next couple of days, along with a blogpost detailing the inner works, and tutorial :)
